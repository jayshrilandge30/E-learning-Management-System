## Technology Stack

### 1. Python
Python stands as the linchpin of the e-Learning Management System, chosen for its versatility, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Python empowers developers to craft elegant solutions to complex problems, facilitating rapid development and seamless integration with other technologies.

### 2. SQLite
SQLite serves as the relational database management system (DBMS) for the e-Learning Management System, offering a lightweight and self-contained solution for data storage and retrieval. SQLite's simplicity and portability make it an ideal choice for small to medium-scale web applications.

### 3. Django Web Framework (Version 4.0.4)
Django serves as the cornerstone of the e-Learning Management System, providing a high-level Python web framework for rapid development and seamless scalability. Django's batteries-included approach equips developers with a rich set of built-in features, including an ORM system, URL routing, authentication, and templating.

### 4. Frontend Technologies
The frontend of the e-Learning Management System is crafted using a modern stack of technologies, including:
- **Bootstrap 5.0.2**: Provides a comprehensive suite of pre-styled components and a responsive grid system.
- **jQuery 3.6.0**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Animate.css 4.1.1**: Adds flair to the user interface with its collection of CSS animations.

### 5. Additional Python Libraries and Packages
In addition to Django's built-in features, the e-Learning Management System leverages a curated selection of Python libraries and packages to enhance functionality and streamline development workflows.
